# Security Policy

**⚠️ Please do not file public GitHub issues for security
vulnerabilities as they are open for everyone to see! ⚠️**

We encourage responsible disclosure practices for security
vulnerabilities.


## Supported Versions

Always update to the latest version of
this Action to keep up with security patches.


## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you've found a security-related bug, we
prefer that you fill out a [vulnerability report on GitHub]
directly.

[vulnerability report on GitHub]:
//github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish/security/advisories/new


## Don't have a GitHub account?

Alternatively, drop an email to
``wk+gh-action-pypi-publish-security`` at ``sydorenko`` dot
``org`` dot ``ua`` instead of filing a ticket or posting to
_any_ public groups. We will try to assess the problem in
timely manner and disclose it in a responsible way.
